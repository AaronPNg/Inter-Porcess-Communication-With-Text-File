# Inter-Porcess-Communication-With-Text-File
This is a simulation of a client and server completed for school.
Multiple instances of the program can be running and will update on every instance through the text file "log" before proceeding with its action.
Each instance of the process has its own "server" class object and synchs through the text file.
The "clear.cpp" file was included to open and reset the text file to a blank file.
A list of the client commands and software purpose is listed in the "main.cpp" file documentation.
